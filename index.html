Opening Keynote: Software Design in the 21st Century - Martin Fowler

              <p> 
                A Play application does not need any container and runs directly in production.
However some organizations prefer to run play applications within a servlet container and can use for this the WAR Plugin.
I am very pleased to share that this plugin is now c…

                At the beginning at the year, I had the chance to present how to organize a play application with the Cake pattern at Ping Conf.
I showed how this pattern enable designing the application as components, how to reduce visibility of specific gateway&#x27;s model…

                I&#x27;d like the share with this post one solution I found to use a Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC) in an asynchronous environment like the play framework.
Edit (September 2014)
Based on one implementation from James Roper, I added one solution based on Akka …

There are a few reasons for this, like:

                In January, I had the pleasure to participate and give a talk at the ping conf.
Ping conf was the first world wide community conference about the Play Framework!.
This conference was very well organized. I&#x27;d like to thank all the organizers one more time …

                Handling data streams
As the version 2 of Play! Framework was published, I was very interested in its new capabilities to handle data streams reactively.
As a technical proof of concept, I wrote a parser that works with chunks of data instead of loading t…
