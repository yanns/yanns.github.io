Honeypot organized the first meetup about [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) in Berlin and I had the pleasure to be invited to talk about my experience.

My topic was [Performance optimisation with GraphQL](http://www.slideshare.net/yann_s/performance-optimisation-with-graphql).

You can find the [slides for the other talks here](http://blog.honeypot.io/honeypot-tech-meetup-graphql/).
