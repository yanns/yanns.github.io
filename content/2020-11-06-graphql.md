I am in a lucky situation: I can experience how my company is using GraphQL, started as an experiment in 2015 until supporting it a public API.

I was invited at a [GraphQL Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/graphql-berlin/events/274229061) to speak about this experience.

If you are interested, you can have a look at the [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/yann_s/bringing-a-public-graphql-api-from-beta-to-production-ready-239122223) or even [watch the talk online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4aP-ryulgQ&t=489s):

There was also a [panel discussion about "GraphQL in Microservices"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4aP-ryulgQ&t=5158s).
