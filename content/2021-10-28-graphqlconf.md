I am in a lucky situation: at commercetools, I've experienced the adoption of GraphQL as a public API, started as an experiment in 2015 until full support in production.

I've already related about this experience at a [GraphQL Meetup](/blog/2020/06/11/graphql-meetup/) and I was invited at [GraphQL Conf 2021](https://graphqlconf.org/) to do the same.

If you are interested, you can have a look at the [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/yann_s/bringing-a-public-graphql-api-from-the-whiteboard-to-production-250332399) or even [watch the talk online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwAITJkozr8&list=PL9GHW1s6-K4ZXvbb_nPdV76KlJslmQaEX&index=16):
