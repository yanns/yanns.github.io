At the [scala meetup in Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Scala-Berlin-Brandenburg/), I presented my investigation on how the [mongo java driver](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/), [reactive streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) and [FS2](https://fs2.io/) are working together.

By comparing akka-stream and fs2, I could find out a difference in how many elements are asked to the reactive publisher.
That resulted in much more mongo queries when using FS2.

- [Source code](https://github.com/yanns/mongo-fs2)

This whole investigation resulted in a [new API in FS2](https://github.com/typelevel/fs2/pull/2666).
With this change, FS2 is now capable of consuming a reactive stream publisher by asking more than one element at a time. When used with the mongo java driver, it results in less queries fetching each more documents.
