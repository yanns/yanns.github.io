  		<p>I had the pleasure to review the book &quot;<a href="http://underscore.io/books/essential-slick/">Essential Slick</a>&quot; about <a href="http://slick.typesafe.com/">Slick 3</a>.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed reading it. For anyone starting a project with Slick, I highly recommend this book, in particular to learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to build queries that can be composed and re-used</li>
<li>how to structure the code</li>
<li>the patterns, anti-patterns and pitfalls to avoid.</li>
</ul>
<p>The book goes over a lot of concepts, from simple queries and data-modeling to views, projections, joins and aggregates.</p>
<p>Slick 3 has very powerful concepts that could be hard to manage. The book tries to teach us how to use them. </p>
<p>Some chapters are more demanding, for instance the 2nd chapter introduces in only a few pages concepts like Queries, Actions, Effects, Streaming.</p>
<p>But once the step managed, I had the feeling to have the good abstractions in my mind to build an application based on Slick. And I could use these concepts to solve the exercises.</p>
<p>What I really liked:</p>
<ul>
<li>exercices: I think I can only learn a library when I use it and the exercises in the book are a very good opportunity to practice.</li>
<li>the sbt console is so configured that I could copy/paste all examples from the book into the console and play with them.</li>
<li>focus on composability and re-usability</li>
<li>the book also points out when one abstraction is not optimal for a particular problem and proposes some alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I missed:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 3.0 version of Slick is a lot about asynchronity, streaming and I wish the book could dig further in these concepts.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, a very good book!</p>
