    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Flicker effect with JavaScript applications</h2>

<p>A lot of web applications are nowadays build with a JavaScript framework, rendering the HTML in the browser (client side).
There are a few reasons for this, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>avoiding server-browser round-trips to modify one HTML element</li>
<li>it is easier to keep the server side stateless if you maintain the state in the browser</li>
<li>the server can expose a public REST API for partners. And your own JavaScript application can use this API, encouraging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">eating our own dog food</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Building a client side JavaScript application is not always easy for teams used to server side code, and a few frameworks can help there, like <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> or <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a></p>

<p>We will look at an <a href="http://play-react.herokuapp.com/clientSide">example with React</a></p>

<p>To display the HTML, a few steps are needed:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The browser loads HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
It can then display some HTML delivered directly by the server.<br>
 <img src="/assets/2014-03-15/server.png" alt="The browser shows the HTML coming from the server" /></p>

<p> With AngularJS, if <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/expression">inline expression</a> are used, the user can see the following for a few milliseconds:<br/>
 hello <br/>
 before AngularJS replaces this expression with its computed value.</p></li>
<li><p>The JavaScript framework manipulates the DOM and the user can then see the application.
 <img src="/assets/2014-03-15/server_and_client.png" alt="The JavaScript application has changed the DOM" /></p></li>
<li><p>If the application needs to display some data from the server, it must first request it with Ajax. The data is displayed only after being received by the browser.
 <img src="/assets/2014-03-15/server_and_client_and_data.png" alt="The JavaScript application has received data and changed the DOM accordingly" /></p></li>
</ol>


<p>(to make the <a href="http://play-react.herokuapp.com/clientSide">flicker</a> more visible, I introduced a latency of 500 ms to simulate a slow backend)</p>

<p>The user experience is not optimal. The application flickers at each step, as the DOM is changed several times in a few seconds.</p>

<h2>Avoiding the flicker effect</h2>

<h3>On the client side</h3>

<p>In the browser, we can mitigate the flicker effect.
Some applications show a spinner as long as the page is not ready to be shown.
The not-yet-completed DOM is hidden before being shown in one final step.</p>

<p>For example, AngularJS provides the <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngCloak">ng-cloak directive</a>.
With this directive, AngularJS can hide the HTML as long as it is not ready.</p>

<h3>Welcome back to server side rendering</h3>

<p>Another option is to pre-render the HTML on the server side and to serve a completely ready HTML to the browser.
That seems quite contradictory to the essence of JavaScript applications, but it is an interesting way.</p>

<p>Form example, React can render a UI component without any browser with <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.rendercomponenttostring">React.renderComponentToString</a>.</p>

<p>With this function, the complete page can be prepared on the server side, send under this form to the browser that can directly display the ready application. On the client side, the same JavaScript code can dynamically manipulate this DOM as a normal client side application.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mhart/react-server-example">React server rendering example</a> demonstrates how to use React&rsquo;s server rendering capabilities. Rendering a JavaScript application on the server side is technically possible because the JavaScript is executed by <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>.</p>

<h3>And what about the JVM?</h3>

<p>If you are not using NodeJS, but the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), you might be disappointed at this time.
Pre-render a JavaScript application is only possible with Node.js?</p>

<p>In Java, there are a few projects that can save us:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/apigee/trireme">trireme</a> provides a Node.js API and can run node.js scripts inside Java. It uses Rhino, the current JavaScript implementation for the JVM. (With Java 8, let&rsquo;s see if trireme will use the new JavaScript implementation, Nashorn, or whether Nashorn will implement the node.js API itself.)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/js-engine">js-engine</a> provides <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka Actors</a> to execute JavaScript code with trireme or with node.js</p></li>
</ul>


<p>As a proof of concept, I implemented a little play application that uses these projects to pre-render a React component on the server side.</p>

<p>The JavaScript is loaded:
<code>scala
val serverside = Play.getFile("public/javascripts/serverside.js")
</code></p>

<p>An actor is created for a JavaScript engine (trireme or node.js)
<code>scala
val engine = Akka.system.actorOf(jsEngine, s"engine-${request.id}")
</code></p>

<p>We receive the data from the database:
<code>scala
data &lt;- initialData
</code>
and let the JavaScript code execute with that data as parameter
<code>scala
result &lt;- (engine ? Engine.ExecuteJs(new File(serverside.toURI), List(data))).mapTo[JsExecutionResult]
</code>
The result is send to the browser
<code>scala
Ok(views.html.index(Html(new String(result.output.toArray, "UTF-8"))))
</code>
complete controller code:
```scala
  // with js-engine
  def serverSideTrireme = serverSideWithJsEngine(Trireme.props())</p>

<p>  // with node
  def serverSideNode = serverSideWithJsEngine(Node.props())</p>

<p>  private def serverSideWithJsEngine(jsEngine: Props) = Action.async { request =></p>

<pre><code>import akka.pattern.ask
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val serverside = Play.getFile("public/javascripts/serverside.js")
implicit val timeout = Timeout(5.seconds)
val engine = Akka.system.actorOf(jsEngine, s"engine-${request.id}")

for {
  data &lt;- initialData
  result &lt;- (engine ? Engine.ExecuteJs(new File(serverside.toURI), List(data))).mapTo[JsExecutionResult]
} yield {
  Ok(views.html.index(Html(new String(result.output.toArray, "UTF-8"))))
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<p>The code <code>serverside.js</code> uses the node.js API to render our main component (CommentBox).
```javascript
var React = require(&lsquo;./react&rsquo;),</p>

<pre><code>CommentBox = require('./CommentBox');
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>It then loads the data given as first parameter in the controller
<code>javascript
// take data from parameters
var data = JSON.parse(process.argv[2]);
</code></p>

<p>It renders the CommentBox component to a String and output it to console.log so that the Scala controller can receive the result with <code>result.output.toArray</code></p>

<p><code>javascript
console.log(React.renderComponentToString(CommentBox(backend)({data: data, onServerSide: true})));
</code></p>

<p>Complete code:
```javascript
var React = require(&lsquo;./react&rsquo;),</p>

<pre><code>CommentBox = require('./CommentBox');
</code></pre>

<p>// take data from parameters
var data = JSON.parse(process.argv[2]);</p>

<p>var backend = {</p>

<pre><code>loadCommentsFromServer: function(settings) {
},
handleCommentSubmit: function(settings) {
}
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>console.log(React.renderComponentToString(CommentBox(backend)({data: data, onServerSide: true})));
```</p>

<p><a href="http://play-react.herokuapp.com/serverSide">This page</a> does not flicker anymore compared to the <a href="http://play-react.herokuapp.com/clientSide">first version</a>.</p>

<h3>Drawback with server side rendering</h3>

<p>The drawback with pre-rendering the page on the server side is that we have to wait to have all the data before sending the page.
In the <a href="http://play-react.herokuapp.com/serverSide">sample application</a>, I introduced a latency when requesting the data to simulate a slow database.</p>

<p>The browser must also wait long before getting any HTML. The following diagram shows that the application deployed on Heroku delivers the page in more than 1s!
<img src="/assets/2014-03-15/wait_for_server.png" alt="The browser is waiting for the server" /></p>

<h3>Can we optimize more?</h3>

<p>We can optimize this version by sending the first bytes of the HTML page before having any data.
When the data is there, we can send the rest of the page.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://play-react.herokuapp.com/serverSideStream">that variant</a>, we can include the CSS and part of the JavaScript in the &lt;HEAD> section of the HTML page.
The browser receives this information very quickly and can begin downloading these assets.
The server lets the connection open and when the rest of the page is ready, it is send to the browser.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2014-03-15/browser_loads_assets.png" alt="The browser can load the CSS and JavaScript" /></p>

<p>To implement this, I used the Facebook’s BigPipe concept as presented in the <a href="http://de.slideshare.net/brikis98/composable-and-streamable-play-apps">talk “Building composable, streaming, testable Play apps” from Yevgeniy Brikman</a></p>

<p>It is not a &ldquo;Silver Bullet&rdquo; as we are still waiting for the data before displaying it to the user (that makes sense).
But the browser can load the stylesheets, the JavaScripts very quickly, leading to a more responsive page.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Handling-data-streams"><a href="#Handling-data-streams">Handling data streams</a></h2>


<p>As the version 2 of Play! Framework was published, I was very interested in its new capabilities to handle data streams reactively.<br/>
As a technical proof of concept, I wrote a parser that works with chunks of data instead of loading the whole content in memory.
My source was a file containing the geographical coordinates of Wikipedia articles.<br/>
(This file is the result of an experience of Triposo, showing how Wikipedia has spread over the planet since the start of the Wikipedia project. Do not forget to watch the other labs from Triposo, they are great!)<br/></p>

<p>Play2 architecture is based on event, and gives us some tools to work with streams of data:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Enumerators">Enumerators</a> produce chunk of data</li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Enumeratees">Enumeratees</a> transform these chunks</li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Iteratees">Iteratees</a> consumes these chunks</li>
</ul>


<p>(For more information, you can read:</p>

</li>
</ul>


<p>The production of data is an Enumerator, sending line after line of the input file:
```scala
def lineEnumerator(source: Source) : Enumerator[String] = {
  val lines = source.getLines()</p>

<p>  Enumerator.fromCallback1[String] ( _ => {</p>

<pre><code>val line = if (lines.hasNext) {
  Some(lines.next())
} else {
  None
}
Future.successful(line)
</code></pre>

<p>  }, source.close)
}
<code>
With an Enumeratee, each line can be possibly parsed into a Coordinate class:
</code>scala
val lineParser: Enumeratee[String, Option[Coordinate]] = Enumeratee.map[String] { line =>
  line.split(&ldquo;\t&rdquo;) match {</p>

<pre><code>case Array(_, IsDouble(latitude), IsDouble(longitude)) =&gt; Some(Coordinate(latitude, longitude))
case _ =&gt; None
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
<code>
The Enumerator can be composed with an Enumeratee with:
</code>scala
val source = scala.io.Source.fromFile(Play.getExistingFile(&ldquo;conf/coosbyid.txt&rdquo;).get)
lineEnumerator(source) &amp;> lineParser
```</p>

<p>I know, the method&rsquo;s name &ldquo;&amp;>&rdquo; can make some of you go away. Please stay! This sign is like the pipe in bash. It is very easy to understand:
<code>scala
lineEnumerator(source) &amp;&gt; lineParser
</code>
is the same as (removing infix notation)
<code>scala
lineEnumerator(source).&amp;&gt;(lineParser)
</code>
which is the same as (method alias)
<code>scala
lineEnumerator(source).through(lineParser)
</code>
Use the last form if the first one is not your taste&hellip; :)</p>

<p>With a last Enumeratee to produce JSON, I can send the stream directly to the browser with Server Send Events.
<code>scala
val source = scala.io.Source.fromFile(Play.getExistingFile("conf/coosbyid.txt").get)
val jsonStream = lineEnumerator(source) &amp;&gt; lineParser &amp;&gt; validCoordinate &amp;&gt; asJson
val eventDataStream = jsonStream &amp;&gt; EventSource()
Ok.chunked(eventDataStream).as("text/event-stream")
</code></p>

<p>What to notice:
Only chunks of data are in memory. The whole content of the source file is never loaded completely.
Each step of the process is isolated in an Enumertor or Enumeratee, making it very easy to modify, to re-use, to combine in a different way.
The Enumerator is reading a file, but you can imagine it could read data from a web service, of from a database.</p>

<h2 id="SSE"><a href="#SSE">Server-Send Events</a></h2>


<p>When we want to send events in &ldquo;real time&rdquo; to the browser, what technologies are available?</p>

<ul>
    <li>polling: the browser pools the server every x milliseconds to check if there is a new message. This method is not very efficient, because a lot of requests are necessary to give the illusion to update the application in real time.</li>
    <li>long-polling (or <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)">Comet</a>): the browser opens a connection to the server (for example in a iframe), and the server keeps the connection opened. When the server wants to push data to the client, it sends this data with the opened connection. The client receives the data, and opens a connection again for further messages. With this method, the browser is always showing that it is waiting for data. This technology does not scale on threaded system, as each opened connection uses a thread. In JEE environment, we need an asynchronous servlet 3.1 not to make the server exploding.</li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/">Server-Send Events (SSE)</a> are quite similar to Comet. The main difference is that the browser manages this connection. For example, it opens the connection again if it falls.</li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/">WebSockets</a> provide a bi-directional, full-duplex communications channels. It is a different protocol than HTTP.</li>
</ul>


<p>I choose to use Server-Send Events instead of WebSockets because of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I've already played with WebSockets and wanted to try something new.</li>
    <li>WebSockets are great and can communicate in both directions. But this technology is a new protocol, sometimes difficult to integrate in an existing infrastructure (Proxy, Load-Balancer, Firewall...) Server-Send Events, on the other hand, use the HTTP protocol. The PaaS <a target="_blank" href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> does not support WebSockets yet, but support SSE. When pushing data from the server to clients is all what you need, SSE can be what is the most appropriate and is <a target="_blank" href="http://caniuse.com/#search=eventsource">well supported</a> (except in IE for the moment)</li>
</ul>




<h2 id="SSE-API"><a href="#SSE-API">Server-Send Events API</a></h2>


<p>The Javascript API is very simple:
```javascript
feed = new EventSource(&lsquo;/stream&rsquo;);</p>

<p>// receive message
feed.addEventListener(&lsquo;message&rsquo;, function(e) {</p>

<pre><code>var data = JSON.parse(e.data);
// do something with data
</code></pre>

<p>}, false);
```</p>

<h2 id="Visualizing-results"><a href="#Visualizing-results">Visualizing the results</a></h2>


<p>As the stream is sending coordinates, my first attempt was to display them on a earth in 3D. For this, I used three.js, which was very simple. The first results were promising, but sadly, the browser could not display so much information in 3D. I had to found an alternative.<br/>
My second attempt was to display these coordinates on a 2D canvas, and that worked well, although less impressive that a 3D map&hellip; :)<br/>
You can see the result on Heroku: <a href="http://wiki-growth.herokuapp.com/">http://wiki-growth.herokuapp.com/</a><br/>
The code source is available on github: <a href="https://github.com/yanns/play2-wiki-growth-sse">https://github.com/yanns/play2-wiki-growth-sse</a><br/>
You can run it by yourself with Play and let heroku sleeping.</p>
